                 Overview and History
             </h2>
             <p>
                 Nizhny Novgorod is Russia's fifth largest city, ranking after Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg. 
                 The population of Nizhny Novgorod is about 1,268,000 (last known at 2015) and the area of the City is 178 sq. miles (411 sq. km). 
             </p>
             <p>
                 Nizhny Novgorod is the administrative center (capital) of the Volga Federal District and the head of Nizhegorodskaya region.
                 The city is located 260 miles (420 km) east of Moscow. It stands at the confluence of two major waterways of the European part of 
                 Russia - the Oka and Volga rivers. This location made the city an important shipping center of the country. The Oka river divides 
                 the city into two parts.
             </p>
             <p> 
                 In 1221 Russian Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich of Vladimir founded a wooden fort at the confluence of the Volga and the Oka rivers. 
                 The settlement was named Nizhny Novgorod. It's name literally means Newtown the Lower, to distinguish it from the older Novgorod. 
                 In 1350, the town became the capital of an independent Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod principality, which occupied a vast territory and 
                 competed with the Moscow principality. During this period, Nizhny Novgorod region was actively populated. Later on in 1425 Suzdal-Nizhny
                 Novgorod principality was annexed to the Moscow principality.
                 In 1817, Makarevskaya Fair moved to Nizhny Novgorod attracting millions of visitors annually. By the middle of the 19th century, 
                 the town was known as the trading capital of the Russian Empire.
                 From 1932 to 1990 Nizhny Novgorod was called Gorky in honor of the famous Russian writer Maxim Gorky.
                 The “closed” status of Gorky City came to the end in 1990, when the original name Nizhny Novgorod was returned to the City.
